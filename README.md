# Diabetes Mellitus 

This is the exam submitted, for the summerschool 'Introduction to Data Science' in 2022.

The workbook is best opened in Google Colabs.

The primary objective of the exam was to build a machine learning algorithm that can predict a diagnosis for diabetes in a patient based on several medical variables and one target variable: the outcome - either 0 or 1.

The machine learning algorithm will produce a sliding scale value between 0 and 1 with a cut-off point (linear regression) above which, the diagnosis will become positive for diabetes.

The solution is split into three parts.

Data import and analysis, in which the data will be visualised and analysed to check for lacunes and anomalies, after which the dataset will be appropriate amended. The amended dataset will be re-evaluated, to ensure it is fit for use in the machine learning model.
Data exploration, in which possible correlations between the medical parameters and the outcome (0 or 1) will be explored.
Machine Learning Model, which will include the results produced by the algorithm, and tests.

Additionally a second exercise involved machine learning to build an algorithm that could detect Renopathy based on an image of a patient's retina, which is an additional diagnostic method to detect diabetes.
